# Flour_and_Flowers
This project was my course project for my SQL class. It simulates a bakery business, and I worked on this with three others. We created several tables, inserts, queries, a data dictionary, an implementation log, and an ER and schema diagram. We also have a presentation and a document detailing our business.
